# Foucault Pendulum: a simple proof that earth rotates
The Foucault's pendulum is a normal pendulum which is big enough for earth's rotation to have effects on it's trajectories. We can use it to prove that the earth is not at rest and is rotating.

The original one was a  28kg bob from 67m string. The pendulum basically swings back and forth and changes the plane of oscillation while it swings. The first time it's motion was observed, pendulum seemed to change its plane of oscillation where in reality the earthâ€™s rotation was the real cause of this observed trajectory

## Equation 
The equation of trajectory of the Foucalt Pendulum gives us the exact position of the bob at some particular time. It can be derivied by using Lagrange's Equation of motion.

And is given by

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ddot{x} - 2\dot{y}\Omega\sin(\lambda) %2B\frac{gx}{l} = 0">

and 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ddot{y} %2B2\dot{x}\Omega\sin(\lambda) %2B\frac{gy}{l} = 0">.

**Note-** 
the motion along z-axis has been neglected as the string is very long and the value of z(the displacement along z-axis) is small as compared to the diplacement along other two directions.

## Method used to solve
Instead of using the long and tediuos path of solving these equation we will be using a little bit of math before we hand over our mathematical function to computer. Multiply the equation of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ddot{y}"> with i and add it to equation with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ddot{x} ">
the final equation obtained is of the form-

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ddot{p} %2B2i\dot{p}\Omega\sin(\lambda) %2B\frac{gp}{l} = 0">

this equation has the solution 


<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p =( C_1 e^{i\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}t}  %2BC_2 e^{-i\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}t})e^{-i \Omega sin(\lambda)}" >
And we will be plotting and animating this equation. 


**First** I have used python to separate the real and complex part of the variable p, this is done using numpy library of python. The real part represents the dispacement along x-axis(x) and the imaginary part represents the displacment along y-axis(y). Then using the values of x and y, the plot has been plotted at different time intervals.

#### Plotting
For plotting I have defined an array for time and then using plot command of the matplotlib the trajectory of the bob is shown. The value of **latitude**
 can be varied according to the position of the pendulum on earth.
#### Animation
A function calculates the value of x and y at a particular time. The output of this function is called by **FuncAnimation** command and which animates the motion of the bob moving. The various parameters of the pendulum can be varied. 

## Conclusion
The motion of the pendulum is not in a plane and rather the  plane of oscillation keeps changing and this simulation shows how this is happening. This is a very simplke yet beautiful proof of earth's rotation
