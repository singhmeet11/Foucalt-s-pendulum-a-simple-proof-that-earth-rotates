# Foucault-s-Pendulum--a-simple-proof-that-earth-rotates
The Foucault's pendulum is a normal pendulum which is big enough for earth's rotation to have effects on it's trajectories. We can use it to prove that the earth is not at rest and is rotating.

The first one was a  28kg bob from 67m string. The pendulum basically swings back and forth and changes the plane of oscillation while it swings. The first time it's motion was observed, pendulum seemed to change its plane of oscillation where in reality the earthâ€™s rotation was the real cause of this observed trajectory

# Equation 
The equation of trajectory of the Foucalt Pendulum can be derivied by using Lagrange's Equation of motion. And is given by
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ddot{x} - 2\dot{y}\Omega\sin(\lambda) %2B\frac{gx}{l} = 0">

and 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ddot{y} %2B2\dot{x}\Omega\sin(\lambda) %2B\frac{gy}{l} = 0">
.

# Solution
Instead of using the long and tediuos path and solving these equation we will be taking a short cut.Multiply the equation of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ddot{y}"> with i and add it to equation with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ddot{x} ">
the final equation obtained is of the form-

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\ddot{p} %2B2i\dot{p}\Omega\sin(\lambda) %2B\frac{gp}{l} = 0">

this eeqution has the solution
